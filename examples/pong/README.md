# About this example

In this example, we train a neural network on the Pong-v0 environment in OpenAI Gym.

**NOTE:** this is experimental. It will not work by default until [pull #48](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api/pull/48) has been merged. You can pull the bleeding-edge branch of [unixpickle/gym-http-api](https://github.com/unixpickle/gym-http-api/) if you are impatient.
