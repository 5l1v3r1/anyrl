# About this example

In this example, we train a neural network on the Pong-v0 environment in OpenAI Gym.

**NOTE:** this is experimental. I have run it out to 525 batches, at which point the average reward is around -18.5 (a random agent tends to get a reward worse than -19.5). I plan to continue running the agent, then experimenting with different hyper-parameter settings.
