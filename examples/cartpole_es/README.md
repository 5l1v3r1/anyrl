# About this example

In this example, we train a neural network on the CartPole-v0 environment in OpenAI Gym. Training is done with Evolution Strategies, a distributed hill-climbing algorithm.

The agent usually solves the problem after 20 to 30 batches (each of size 50). On my machine, this takes about 20 seconds.
