# anyrl

**NOTE:** This repository is deprecated. You are probably looking for [anyrl-py](https://github.com/unixpickle/anyrl-py), a newer, more full-featured RL library written in Python.

Package anyrl implements various APIs for Reinforcement Learning. This includes training algorithms like [Trust Region Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477), a gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithm. It also includes APIs to integrate with various RL environments.

This repository is based on the [anynet](https://github.com/unixpickle/anynet) deep learning framework, which is no longer maintained.
